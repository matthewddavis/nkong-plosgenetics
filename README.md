This project is the Mef2/Ebf1 binding project with Nikki Kong, resulting in a publication in PLoS Genetics.

This codebase is not currently prepared to recreate the entire analysis from one script, but all of the components required should be present. If you are interested in recreating the analysis precisely as it was done, this is possible. In this case, please contact Matt Davis (matthew.d.davis@mail.utexas.edu).
